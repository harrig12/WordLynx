## Our Story

WordLynx grew out of admiration of the [what3words](https://what3words.com/)
addressing system, which generates short, memorable
addresses for everywhere in the world, which is great; but proprietary, so not necessarily accessible. As well as frustration with Googleâ€™s new [plus codes](https://plus.codes/) addressing system that are not very
human friendly, and are sort of open access, but not really.

By combining and simplifying the ideas behind these two systems we realized we could do something better. So, now, with WordLynx, anyone anywhere in the world can have a simple, memorable, three-word address label free of charge.

## What's next?

We're working on applying WordLynx to diverse domains:

* Phone numbers
* Addresses
* Mapping
* Data collection and reporting 
* Research
* ID numbers
* The human genome
* Citizen science projects
* Bank accounts
* Drivers license
* Health mapping
* Environmentl monitoring
